## Description:
Word Hunter is a competitive multiplayer game where the objective is to quickly type words before they disappear. Each player will get the same grid of words which gradually fade out after a random interval. Typing this word will earn the player points according to the length of the word, so they are incentivized to pursue more difficult words. However, only one player may be typing any given word at a time; one player can lock other players out of a word by typing its first character. If they misspell, the word will be unlocked and other players can attempt to claim it). Once a player finishes a word, it will be removed from the grid, and a new word comes in at a random position.
